Tutorial on how to use Git, Webstorm, and Github!


To begin with, what is Git, Webstorm, and Github?


Git is a verison control system that essentially allows for tracking of changes in your source code! Git is free and open source and allows you to work on your projects big or small effectively!


To continue, what is Webstorm? Well Webstorm is an IDE, an integrated development environment. Webstorm is developed and created by JetBrains, who also have multiple other IDES. (www.jetbrains.com) Webstorm is typically used for coding in languages such as JavaScript and HTML and other related langauges that coninicde with it. 


What is Github? Like Git, Github is a version control system that keeps track of changes to your source code! Github allows you to collabrate with others in real time at the exact same time, elevating collabration on projects to an efficent high level rate. It can work directly with Git itself!


So how can we get these 3 key contributors onto our devices?

Step 1:

For Git, the steps are to go to the website, https://git-scm.com/downloads. 

From here you are going to want to select the correct operating system you are using and the website will ensure you install it correctly. 



Step 2:

Now to install Webstorm so you can create beautiful code, you are going to want to start from the link: https://www.jetbrains.com/student/. 

This link will allow JetBrains to verify if you are a student after you enter your information. It will take a couple days for the verification. 


After being verified you are going to want to link your free license to your JetBrains account. 

From there you will be able to download webstorm and any other JetBrains IDE with your free license. You are going to want to download webstorm or others of your chooisng and open the downloading package on your device. After following the prompts from your device and agreeing to terms, Webstorm will start installing and you can then use the installed software!



Step 3: 

To start using Github, you are going to need to create a Github Account!

To create a Github account you are going to go to the link: https://github.com/join

From this, enter your credientals and you now have a Github account!




Step 4: Lets link together the all 3 softwares to have a workflow to use. 

To connect your newly created Github account that saves your code to your new Webstorm that allows you to create code, follow this:

In your Webstorm, press Ctrl+Alt+S to open system preferences. You are going to select Version control Git. Enter the path to the git.exe. 




Step 5: 

Now one of the most important parts of your Github Account, is having a set place to store your code. This is called a Repository. In your Repository you can commit code for whatever the project you may be working on and store it there. 

Click the + sign at the top of your profile homepage in the right corner and choose "Create New repository". 

You could also directly create a repository from Webstorm!

To do so select VCS on Webstorm and then Import into Version Control.

Github allows you to do many things with your code through Collabration and many methods to do what you need to do through.

You could branch, clone or even fetch code. 

You can Merge code or files, or do push/pull requests depending on your project.

What Github allows you to do is simply work together at a high level. 




Step 6:

To make your files flow from Webstorm to Git you can do the following.

To create a file in Webstorm simply choosee file- HTML- HTML 5 or File- Stylesheet.

After this, The Add to Git Dialog will open and simply click Add so that the file stores to a local file system. 


Now you know how to not only use Git, Github, and Webstorm, but you know how to use all 3 together and safely install them!




Glossary:

**Branch** - Branching in Github simply a outside version of your main repository. A branch does not take over the main repositrory, allows you to work outside of it and later add your changes back into the main. 

**Clone** - A clone is a copy of your repository stored on your device, not the cloud software like Github. 

**Commit** - A commit is changes to the file. Example being, changing your orignal README file to contain more information than it orignally did. 

**Fetch** - Fetch is when you create changes to remote repoistory to local storage without having to commit them. 

**GIT** - Git is a open source version control system that can handle your projects big or small. Can see changes to source code.

**Github** - Github is a open source version control system that like git can see changes to your source code. Github can be found online

**Merge** - Merge is when changes are combined with other changes whether it be a branch or the original file. 

**Merge Conflict** - Merge Conflict is when changes are made on the same line of code or overall file or deleted by two different users.

**Push** - Push is when the commited changes your created move back into your remote repository

**Pull** - Pull is when you want to move changes from your remote repository to your local one to match them.

**Remote** - Remote is your repository on Github

**Repository**- Repository is where you can save all your source code and track the changes and progress on it.
